# Code for EJ

Code for EJ is an initiative by the US Digital Service Justice40 team. We believe that to more effectively address environmental or climate justice issues, we need to invest in an entire ecosystem of open source tech and data. Investing in an ecosystem means fostering community amongst folks of different skill sets and backgrounds and building tech/data capacity in communities most impacted by environmental/climate justice issues and in organizations working to tackle those issues.
Code for EJ is relevant to you if:
1) You have an idea (or current effort) for an environmental or climate justice project and you need help, especially from folks with product, tech, design, or data skills
2) You are a person with product, tech, design, or data skills and you want to work on environmental/climate justice projects
3) You are a member of a community impacted by environmental/climate justice issues or you are an organization working with impacted communities, and you want to learn how our community or tech/data more broadly can help you
4) You are working on environmental/climate justice and you want to connect with, share with, and learn from folks working on similar problems
5) You are a member of the public and generally interested in whatâ€™s going with regards to environmental/climate justice work
